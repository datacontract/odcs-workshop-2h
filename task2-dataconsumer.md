- you want to create a dashboard to see the outliers of shipments to track how well your carrier is delivering the shipments
- you need data about shipments that have not been delivered, including their tracking number, where they are right now, how long they are underway, and since when they haven't been changed.
- you want the data to be very fresh (you want 1min, but are also okay with at most 1h)
- you need the data to be there forever (unlimited data retention)
